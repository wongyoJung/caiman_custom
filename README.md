A Python toolbox for large scale **Ca**lcium **Im**aging data **An**alysis and behavioral analysis.

CaImAn implements a set of essential methods required in the analysis pipeline of large scale calcium imaging data. Fast and scalable algorithms are implemented for motion correction, source extraction, spike deconvolution, and component registration across multiple days. It is suitable for both two-photon and one-photon fluorescence microscopy data, and can be run in both batch and online modes. CaImAn also contains some routines for the analysis of behavior from video cameras. A list of features as well as relevant references can be found [here](https://caiman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CaImAn_features_and_references.html).

## Requirements

Right now, CaImAn works and is supported on the following platforms:
* Linux on Intel CPUs
* MacOS on Intel CPUs
* Windows on Intel CPUs

16G RAM is strongly recommended, and depending on datasets, 32G or more may be helpful. ARM-based versions of Apple hardware are likely to be eventually supported (although current available systems of that sort have little RAM).

CaImAn presently targets Python 3.7. Parts of CaImAn are written in C++, but apart possibly during install, this is not visible to the user. There is also an [older implementation](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn-MATLAB) of CaImAn in Matlab (unsupported). That version can be used with [MCMC spike inference](https://github.com/epnev/continuous_time_ca_sampler) 

## Install

The supported ways to install CaImAn use the Anaconda python distribution. If you do not already have it, first install a 3.x version for your platform from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Familiarise yourself with Conda before going further.

There are a few supported install methods.

The easiest (and strongly recommended on Windows) is to use a binary conda package, installed as the environment is built. Install this with 'conda create -n caiman -c conda-forge caiman'. This is suitable for most use, if you don't need to change the internals of the caiman package. You do not need to fetch the source code with this approach.

Another option is to build it yourself; you will need a working compiler (easy on Linux, fairly easy on OSX, fairly involved on Windows). Clone the sources of this repo, and do a 'pip install .' or 'pip install -e .' The former is a standard install, the latter is more suitable for active development on the caiman sources.

There are other ways to build/use caiman, but they may get less or no support depending on how different they are.

More detailed docs on installation can be found [here](./docs/source/Installation.rst).

After installing the software, the caimanmanager.py script (which will be put in your path on Linux and OSX) is used to unpack datafiles and demos into a directory called caiman\_data. 

## Getting Started

If you used caimanmanager to unpack the demos and data files, you will find in the caiman\_data folder a set of demos and jupyter notebooks. demo\_pipeline.py and demo\_behavior.py (or their notebook equivalents) are good introductions to the code.

CaImAn implements a variety of algorithms for analyzing calcium (and voltage) imaging data. A list of references that provide the theoretical background and original code for the included methods can be found [here](https://caiman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CaImAn_features_and_references.html). 
 
If you use this code please cite the corresponding papers where original methods appeared as well the companion paper.

### Real-time analysis of microendoscopic 1p data

Our online algorithms can be used for real-time analysis of live-streaming data. An example for real-time analysis of microendoscopic 1p data is shown in the notebook `demos/notebooks/demo_realtime_cnmfE.ipynb`.
For more information about the approach check the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008565).

### Analysis pipeline for Voltage Imaging data

VolPy is an analysis pipeline for voltage imaging data. The analysis is based on following objects:

* `MotionCorrect`: An object for motion correction which can be used for both rigid and piece-wise rigid motion correction.
* `volparams`: An object for setting parameters of voltage imaging. It can be set and changed easily and is passed into the algorithms.
* `VOLPY`: An object for running the spike detection algorithm and saving results.

In order to use VolPy, you must install Keras into your conda environment. You can do this by activating your environment, and then issuing the command "conda install -c conda-forge keras".

To see examples of how these methods are used, please consult the `demo_pipeline_voltage_imaging.py` script in the `demos/general` folder. For more information about the approach check the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.02.892323v1).

There is also a [general paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008806) on this pipeline
